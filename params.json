It leverages\r\nCapistrano and Git to cleanly deploy new versions across multiple\r\nservers. Essentially a command-line interface to both of these tools,\r\nRain emphasizes convention over configuration and attempts to make\r\ncontinuous deployment between teams more organized and therefore, more\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nWe use this deployment script at [eLocal](http://elocal.com) to deploy a\r\ncluster of staging and production web app servers. Not only do we use it\r\nfor our main site, but the API application as well, which was the\r\nprimary motivation in developing this gem: the ability to share its code\r\nacross all of our applications.\r\n\r\n## install it\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ gem install rain\r\n```\r\n\r\nor add the following to Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'rain'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## use it\r\n\r\nRead the [documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/eLocal/rain/master/frames) for more info on how to use Rain with your Rails app.","tagline":"by eLocal"}
